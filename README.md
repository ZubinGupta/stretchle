#### Video Demo:  <Here(https://youtu.be/iNjnxU0fjh0)>
#### Description:
This is a wordle variant I created, that to my knowledge has not been created before.
THe premise is that instead of having a fixed word length, the word can be any length from 5-9 letters.
While it seems simple, having so many possibilities as to what the word could be adds another layer of challenge to the game.
To those who want to attempt it, good luck!
